# Python source files
## First milestone

All source files have been created in Google Colaboratory.

The scripts are meant to be executed in the following order:
- `wav_splitter.ipynb`
- `wav2stft.ipynb`
- `mixer.ipynb`

`Mix-demix_test` is a demonstration of our short audio mixing and masking library that is in `audio_masking.py`

## Second milestone

- update of `mixer.ipynb`
- implementation of CNN model in `model1.ipynb`

## Third milestone

- implementation of CNN model and training in `Model_and_training.ipynb`
- implementation of SDR calculation and demonstration on longer utterance in `Demonstration_of_results.ipynb`
- `unet_softmax.csv` with a sample training result
- `unet_softmax.hdf5` with the weights of the final neural network
