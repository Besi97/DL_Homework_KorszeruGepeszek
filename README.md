# Talker separation problem
The aim of our homework is to create a network that is capable of separating the speech of two speakers who speak simultanously. The method of recording is presumed to be single channeled (mono/monaural). 

# Data sets
The data source is the audiobook form of the Charles Dickens novel Hard Times, read by ten different speakers. To create input data we split and mix these signals on top of each other.
